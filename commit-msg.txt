fix: critical security fixes - Redis fallback, JWT hardening, CORS restriction, XSS sanitization

- C1: Add in-memory rate limiter fallback when Redis unavailable
- C2: Remove hardcoded JWT secret, auto-generate with warning if unset
- C3: Restrict CORS to production frontend + localhost only
- C4: Replace weak XSS sanitizer with nh3 (Rust-based allowlist)
- Bonus: Set debug=False in production, protect DATABASE_URL fallback
